# Scratchpad: Issue #1 - Project Foundation & Development Environment Setup

**Issue Link**: https://github.com/m2ix4i/JSON-Chunking/issues/1

## Issue Summary
Set up the foundational project structure and development environment for the IFC JSON chunking system.

## Analysis
- **Context**: Greenfield project for IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) JSON chunking
- **Scope**: Complete development infrastructure setup
- **Priority**: High - Foundation for all other components
- **Current State**: Empty repository with only git and Claude configuration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Structure
1. **Basic Project Structure**
   - Create `src/ifc_json_chunking/` package directory
   - Create `tests/` and `docs/` directories  
   - Add `__init__.py` files for Python package structure
   - Create main module skeleton

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Use Poetry for modern Python dependency management
   - Create `pyproject.toml` with project metadata
   - Define development vs production dependencies
   - Target Python 3.9+ with async support

### Phase 2: Development Environment
3. **Docker Setup**
   - Create `Dockerfile` with Python 3.9+ base image
   - Create `docker-compose.yml` for development environment
   - Add `.dockerignore` for optimal Docker builds

4. **Code Quality Foundation**
   - Configure Black (code formatting)
   - Configure isort (import sorting)  
   - Configure mypy (static type checking)
   - Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for git hooks

### Phase 3: Infrastructure
5. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Create structured logging module with JSON output
   - Configure different log levels for environments
   - Add logging utilities and formatters

6. **Configuration Management**
   - Create config management system supporting multiple environments
   - Add configuration validation with schemas
   - Support environment variables and config files

7. **Error Handling Framework**
   - Define custom exception hierarchy for domain-specific errors
   - Create error handling patterns and utilities
   - Add error context and tracing support

### Phase 4: Testing & CI/CD
8. **Testing Framework**
   - Configure pytest with coverage reporting
   - Create test utilities and fixtures
   - Set up test directory structure with example tests

9. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow
   - Add jobs for testing, linting, type checking
   - Configure code coverage reporting and quality gates

### Phase 5: Documentation
10. **Documentation**
    - Create comprehensive `README.md` with setup instructions
    - Add API documentation structure
    - Include usage examples and contribution guidelines

## Technical Decisions
- **Package Manager**: Poetry (over pip-tools) for better dependency resolution
- **Python Version**: 3.9+ for modern features and async support
- **Testing**: pytest for comprehensive testing capabilities
- **Code Quality**: Black + isort + mypy + pre-commit for consistency
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for integrated workflow
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based with potential for Sphinx later

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- [x] Python package structure with src/, tests/, docs/ directories → Steps 1
- [x] requirements.txt or pyproject.toml with all dependencies → Step 2  
- [x] Development environment setup (Docker + docker-compose) → Step 3
- [x] Basic logging configuration with structured output → Step 5
- [x] Configuration management for different environments → Step 6
- [x] Error handling framework with custom exceptions → Step 7
- [x] Testing framework setup with pytest → Step 8
- [x] Code quality tools configuration (pre-commit hooks) → Step 4
- [x] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for testing and linting → Step 9
- [x] README.md with setup and usage instructions → Step 10

## Next Steps
1. Create new branch `feature/issue-1-project-foundation`  
2. Implement each step with individual commits
3. Test the complete setup
4. Open PR for review

## Notes
- This is the foundation issue - all subsequent features will depend on this setup
- Focus on maintainability and developer experience
- Ensure the setup scales for future IFC JSON chunking functionality
